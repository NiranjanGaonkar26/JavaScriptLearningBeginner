//Rules for naming a variable
//Names can contain letters, digits and $ and _ characters
//Cannot start with a digit
//Names are case sensitive

//Best practices
//camel casing

//keywords to define a variable

//1. let -> mutable variable
//2. const -> IMMUTABLE variable
//3. var -> similar to let, but is not used anymore

let firstName = "Niranjan";        //In JS a string can be enclosed in either single or double quotes
let lastName = "G C";
let dateBirth = new Date("January 1, 1991");

//JS is dynamically typed language
//JS uses garbage collection

const a = "hi";
// a = "Error"; not possible to this as const makes a variable immutable
